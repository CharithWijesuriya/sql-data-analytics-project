### Welcome to the ** Advanced SQL Data Analytics Project** repository.

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses 
such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. 
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze 
data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL 
queries.

This project builds upon the dataset from my previous work, sql-data-warehouse-project, continuing the analysis from its 
conclusion. By leveraging the existing data, this project aims to further explore key insights and expand upon the findings 
of the previous study.
